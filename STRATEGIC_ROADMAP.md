**Version:** 3.0
**Last Updated:** November 18, 2025
**Status:** Playable Beta Achieved
**Philosophy:** Robustness, Polish, and Scale

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

**Current State:** Playable Beta (Core loop complete, AI fallback active, UI functional)
**Goal:** Production-Ready Multiplayer Game
**Timeline:** 4-8 weeks to v1.0
**Strategy:** Harden testing → Polish UX → Expand Multiplayer Features

---

## 🚀 Strategic Phases

### **PHASE 1: Core Playability (COMPLETED)** ✅

- [x] Game Engine & Rules (Movement, Capture, Lines, Territory)
- [x] Board Management (8x8, 19x19, Hex)
- [x] Basic AI Integration (Service + Fallback)
- [x] Frontend Basics (Board, Lobby, HUD, Victory)
- [x] Infrastructure (Docker, DB, WebSocket)

### **PHASE 2: Robustness & Testing (IN PROGRESS)**

**Priority:** P0 - CRITICAL
**Goal:** Ensure 100% rule compliance and stability

#### 2.1 Comprehensive Scenario Testing

- [ ] Build test matrix for all FAQ edge cases
- [ ] Implement scenario tests for complex chain captures
- [ ] Verify all board types (especially Hexagonal edge cases)

#### 2.2 Sandbox Stage 2

- [x] Stabilize client-local sandbox with unified “place then move” turn semantics
      for both human and AI seats (including mixed games), and automatic local AI
      turns when it is an AI player’s move. Implemented in the browser-only
      sandbox via `ClientSandboxEngine` and the `/sandbox` path of `GamePage`,
      with coverage from `ClientSandboxEngine.mixedPlayers` tests.
- [ ] Ensure parity between backend and sandbox engines and improve AI-vs-AI
      termination behaviour using the sandbox AI simulation diagnostics
      (`ClientSandboxEngine.aiSimulation` with `RINGRIFT_ENABLE_SANDBOX_AI_SIM=1`),
      as tracked in P0.2 / P1.4 of `KNOWN_ISSUES.md`.

### **PHASE 3: Multiplayer Polish**

**Priority:** P1 - HIGH
**Goal:** Seamless online experience

#### 3.1 Spectator Mode

- [ ] UI for watching active games
- [ ] Real-time updates for spectators

#### 3.2 Social Features

- [ ] In-game chat
- [ ] User profiles and stats
- [ ] Leaderboards

#### 3.3 Matchmaking

- [ ] Automated matchmaking queue
- [ ] ELO-based matching

### **PHASE 4: Advanced AI**

**Priority:** P2 - MEDIUM
**Goal:** Challenging opponents for all skill levels

#### 4.1 Machine Learning

- [ ] Train neural network models
- [ ] Deploy advanced models to Python service

#### 4.2 Advanced Heuristics

- [ ] Implement MCTS/Minimax for intermediate levels
