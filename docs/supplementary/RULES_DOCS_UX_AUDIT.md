# RingRift Rules Documentation & UX Audit

**Date:** November 24, 2025
**Auditor:** Documentation and UX Agent
**Scope:** Player-facing text, developer documentation, inline comments, and configuration.

---

## 3.1 Summary

This audit compares the current documentation and user experience text against the authoritative **RR‑CANON** (`RULES_CANONICAL_SPEC.md`) and the actual codebase behaviour.

As of 2025‑12‑05, dedicated rules‑UX specs have been added under `docs/` (see §3.6) and partially wired into the client, telemetry, and teaching surfaces. Future remediation work for the findings below SHOULD treat those specs as the canonical contract for copy, weird‑state handling, and teaching scenarios.

See also the consolidated rules concepts index in [`docs/UX_RULES_CONCEPTS_INDEX.md`](docs/UX_RULES_CONCEPTS_INDEX.md:1) for up‑to‑date mappings between rules semantics, UX surfaces, teaching flows, and telemetry/tests.

**Headline Findings:**

1.  **Critical UX Mismatch on Chain Captures:** The GameHUD explicitly tells players they can "end your turn" during chain captures, but RR‑CANON-R103 mandates **mandatory continuation** if any capture is available. This is a high-severity rule misstatement in the UI.
2.  **Victory Condition Misinformation:** The Victory Modal describes Ring Elimination as "eliminating **all** opponent rings," whereas the actual rule (RR‑CANON-R170) and implementation is **>50%** of total rings.
3.  **Canonical Rulebook Drift:** The player-facing `ringrift_complete_rules.md` contains obsolete rules regarding movement landing (Section 10.2) and forced elimination (FAQ Q24) that contradict the canonical spec and current engine behaviour.
4.  **Hidden Implementation Compromises:** Several known engineering compromises (e.g., board repair logic, placement cap approximations) are documented in internal analysis files but missing from the primary developer guides (`RULES_ENGINE_ARCHITECTURE.md` or code comments), creating a risk of future regression.
5.  **Strong Developer Alignment:** Recent engine code (GameEngine, RuleEngine, shared helpers) is exceptionally well-commented with direct references to RR‑CANON sections, reducing the risk of developer misunderstanding.

## 3.2 Player-Facing Rules & UX

This section reviews text visible to end-users in the web client and the primary rulebook.

### HUD & In-Game Text

| ID           | Severity   | Location                  | Issue                                                                                                                                                                                                | Remediation                                                                                                 |
| :----------- | :--------- | :------------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **DOCUX-P1** | **High**   | `GameHUD.tsx` (PhaseInfo) | **Chain Capture:** Description reads "Continue capturing or **end your turn**". This implies optionality. RR‑CANON-R103 states chain capturing is **mandatory** while legal moves exist.             | Change to: "Continue capturing (Mandatory)". Remove "or end your turn".                                     |
| **DOCUX-P2** | **Medium** | `VictoryModal.tsx`        | **Ring Elimination:** Description reads "Victory by eliminating **all** opponent rings". RR‑CANON-R170 is **>50%** of total rings. Eliminating all is a win, but not the threshold.                  | Change to: "Victory by eliminating ringsPerPlayer rings."                                                   |
| **DOCUX-P3** | Low        | `GameHUD.tsx` (PhaseInfo) | **Line Reward:** Description "Choose how to process your line" implies choice exists for _all_ lines. For exact-length lines (RR‑CANON-R122 Case 1), there is no choice (must collapse & eliminate). | Change to: "Process line reward" (generic) or conditionally show "Choose reward" only for overlength lines. |
| **DOCUX-P4** | Low        | `GameHUD.tsx` (SubPhase)  | **Territory:** "Processing disconnected regions" is vague regarding the **self-elimination cost** (RR‑CANON-R145). Players may be surprised they have to lose a ring.                                | Add tooltip or sub-text: "Regions collapse; you must eliminate one outside ring per region."                |

**Implementation status snapshot (2025‑12‑05, post‑W‑UX work):**

- DOCUX‑P1 – Addressed: GameHUD chain capture copy now describes mandatory continuation without suggesting you can “end your turn”.
- DOCUX‑P2 – Addressed: Victory/Help copy for Ring Elimination now consistently describes the >50% global elimination threshold.
- DOCUX‑P3 – Addressed: Line‑processing HUD copy no longer promises “Choose how to process your line” for all cases; generic copy is used unless a real choice exists.
- DOCUX‑P4 – Addressed: Territory HUD and sub‑phase copy now explicitly mentions the “one outside ring per disconnected region” self‑elimination cost.

### Public Rulebook (`ringrift_complete_rules.md`)

| ID           | Severity   | Location                             | Issue                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Remediation                                                                                 |
| :----------- | :--------- | :----------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **DOCUX-P5** | **Medium** | `ringrift_complete_rules.md` §10.2   | **Movement Landing:** States capture landing "differs from non-capture movement in 19×19/Hex", implying non-capture must stop at first valid space. RR‑CANON-R091/R101 unifies this: **all** movement can land on any valid space beyond markers. | Update §10.2 to reflect the Unified Landing Rule (RR‑CANON-R091) matching the Compact Spec. |
| **DOCUX-P6** | Low        | `ringrift_complete_rules.md` FAQ Q24 | **Forced Elimination:** Suggests a player might be unable to perform forced elimination because "all caps have already been eliminated". RR‑CANON-R100/R022 clarifies any stack has a cap.                                                        | Update FAQ Q24 to state forced elimination is always possible if you control a stack.       |
| **DOCUX-P7** | Low        | `ringrift_complete_rules.md` §11.2   | **Line Length:** Uses "4 or 5" loosely.                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Standardize to "Required Length (3 for 8x8, 4 for 19x19/Hex)" to match RR‑CANON-R001.       |

**Implementation status snapshot (2025‑12‑08, post‑canonical alignment):**

- DOCUX‑P5 – **Resolved**: §10.2 now explicitly states the unified landing rule: "This landing flexibility matches the unified non‑capture movement rule for all board types: in both movement and capture, any landing that satisfies the distance and landing constraints is legal."
- DOCUX‑P6 – **Resolved**: FAQ Q24 now includes the clarification: "Note that by definition, any stack you control must have at least one ring of your colour at the top—that's what 'control' means. Therefore, there is always a non-empty cap to eliminate."
- DOCUX‑P7 – **Resolved**: §11.2 now consistently uses "Required Length (3 for 8×8, 4 for 19×19/Hex)" throughout, with no ambiguous "4 or 5" references.

## 3.3 Developer Documentation and Comments

This section reviews internal documentation for engineering accuracy.

| ID           | Classification              | Location                                  | Issue                                                                                                                                        | Recommended Action                                                                                             |
| :----------- | :-------------------------- | :---------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **DOCUX-D1** | **Historical / Superseded** | `deprecated/RULES_GAP_ANALYSIS_REPORT.md` | Describes forced elimination auto-selection as a "divergence". RR‑CANON-R100 now accepts this as a valid implementation choice (CCE-007).    | Ensure file remains in `deprecated/` and is not referenced as current status.                                  |
| **DOCUX-D2** | **Ambiguous**               | `RULES_ENGINE_ARCHITECTURE.md`            | Does not explicitly mention the **Board Repair** logic (`CCE-001`) in `BoardManager.ts`. Developers might assume invariants are strict-only. | Add a "Defensive Invariants" section to `RULES_ENGINE_ARCHITECTURE.md` documenting the repair pass.            |
| **DOCUX-D3** | **Design-intent match**     | `src/server/game/GameEngine.ts`           | Comments reference "automatic consequences" vs "move-driven decision phases".                                                                | Keep. This accurately reflects the transition state described in `RULES_IMPLEMENTATION_MAPPING.md`.            |
| **DOCUX-D4** | **Ambiguous**               | `src/client/sandbox/sandboxTerritory.ts`  | Contains deprecated region search logic alongside new shared delegates.                                                                      | Add `@deprecated` JSDoc tag to the legacy functions to prevent accidental usage.                               |
| **DOCUX-D5** | **Ambiguous**               | `AI_ARCHITECTURE.md`                      | Mentions AI "biasing against Option 2" for lines.                                                                                            | Update to reflect that `HeuristicAI` should eventually support Option 2 logic per `AI_IMPROVEMENT_BACKLOG.md`. |

## 3.4 Configuration and Defaults

| ID           | Config Key            | Location                       | Issue                                                                                                                                                | Recommendation                                                                                            |
| :----------- | :-------------------- | :----------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **DOCUX-C1** | `RINGRIFT_RULES_MODE` | `src/shared/utils/envFlags.ts` | Defaults to `'ts'`. Docs explain `'python'` and `'shadow'`, but implications for **parity failures** in shadow mode aren't prominent in `README.md`. | Add a "Rules Engine Modes" section to `README.md` explaining that `shadow` logs mismatches but trusts TS. |
| **DOCUX-C2** | `ringsPerPlayer`      | `src/shared/types/game.ts`     | Used for placement caps. Implementation approximates this using stack heights (`CCE-002`).                                                           | Add comment to `BOARD_CONFIGS` in `types/game.ts` noting the implementation approximation (CCE-002).      |

## 3.5 Cross-Reference to Known Implementation Compromises

Mapping from `RULES_CONSISTENCY_EDGE_CASES.md` (CCE) to Documentation/UX needs.

| CCE ID      | Description                                                                                                       | Status       | Doc/UX Action Required                                                                                                                                            |
| :---------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CCE-001** | **Board Repair:** Overlapping markers are silently deleted.                                                       | Undocumented | **Create DOCUX-D2**: Document this defensive behaviour in Architecture docs.                                                                                      |
| **CCE-002** | **Placement Cap:** Counts total stack height, not specific ring colors.                                           | Undocumented | **Create DOCUX-C2**: Add comment to `BOARD_CONFIGS` or `PlacementValidator`.                                                                                      |
| **CCE-003** | **Sandbox Skip:** Sandbox has no `skip_placement` move; infers phase.                                             | Undocumented | Add note to `ClientSandboxEngine.ts` header about this divergence from backend.                                                                                   |
| **CCE-004** | **Capture Chain Helpers:** Shared helper is a stub; logic lives in GameEngine.                                    | Documented   | `RULES_IMPLEMENTATION_MAPPING.md` already notes this. No action.                                                                                                  |
| **CCE-005** | **Territory Self-Elimination:** "Outside" check is implicit in ordering.                                          | Undocumented | Add comment to `territoryDecisionHelpers.ts` clarifying that interior stacks are already gone.                                                                    |
| **CCE-006** | **Last Player Standing:** Previously not explicit; now implemented as early R172 victory via shared LPS tracking. | Resolved     | Ensure references in rules docs and UX specs point to the LPS helpers (`lpsTracking.ts`, `VictoryAggregate`) rather than describing play-to-completion behaviour. |
| **CCE-007** | **Forced Elim Heuristic:** Auto-selects smallest cap.                                                             | Undocumented | Add comment to `TurnEngine.ts` that this is a deterministic tie-break choice.                                                                                     |
| **CCE-008** | **Phase Ordering:** Move->Line->Territory->Victory.                                                               | Documented   | Well-covered in `GameEngine.ts` comments. No action.                                                                                                              |

## 3.6 Related Rules-UX Specs

The following documents define the canonical contracts for rules UX copy, telemetry, weird-state mapping, and teaching flows:

- [`UX_RULES_COPY_SPEC.md`](../UX_RULES_COPY_SPEC.md:1) – Canonical copy for HUD, VictoryModal, TeachingOverlay, and sandbox rules explanations.
- [`UX_RULES_TELEMETRY_SPEC.md`](../UX_RULES_TELEMETRY_SPEC.md:1) – Rules-UX telemetry envelope, event types, and hotspot metric definitions (W-UX-1).
- [`UX_RULES_WEIRD_STATES_SPEC.md`](../UX_RULES_WEIRD_STATES_SPEC.md:1) – Reason codes and UX mappings for ANM/FE, structural stalemate, and Last-Player-Standing outcomes (W-UX-2).
- [`UX_RULES_TEACHING_SCENARIOS.md`](../UX_RULES_TEACHING_SCENARIOS.md:1) – Scenario-driven teaching flows for complex mechanics such as mini-regions, capture chains, and line-vs-territory turns (W-UX-3).
- [`UX_RULES_IMPROVEMENT_LOOP.md`](../UX_RULES_IMPROVEMENT_LOOP.md:1) – Telemetry-driven process for iterating on rules UX and onboarding over time (W-UX-4).
- [`UX_RULES_CONCEPTS_INDEX.md`](../UX_RULES_CONCEPTS_INDEX.md:1) – High-risk rules concepts index (semantic/navigation map).
- This audit (current file) – Findings and status for documentation + UX alignment.
- **New (W5):** The concordance table in §4 below – **concept → rules docs → in-app copy → docs** mapping.
- **New (W6):** Numbered iteration logs under `docs/ux/rules_iterations/` – see:
  - [`UX_RULES_IMPROVEMENT_ITERATION_0001.md`](../ux/rules_iterations/UX_RULES_IMPROVEMENT_ITERATION_0001.md:1) for the initial hotspot-oriented plan,
  - [`UX_RULES_IMPROVEMENT_ITERATION_0002.md`](../ux/rules_iterations/UX_RULES_IMPROVEMENT_ITERATION_0002.md:1) for backfilled ANM/FE + structural stalemate + mini-region game-end explanation work (W1–W5),
  - [`UX_RULES_IMPROVEMENT_ITERATION_0003.md`](../ux/rules_iterations/UX_RULES_IMPROVEMENT_ITERATION_0003.md:1) for backfilled mini-region and capture-chain teaching flows (W1–W5).

Future UX and documentation remediation work referenced in this audit should treat these specs as the contract for concrete copy, telemetry, and teaching changes.

## 3.7 Suggested Next Remediation Targets (Post–Dec 2025)

Given the partial remediation to date (see §3.2 implementation snapshot), the next high-leverage items from this audit are:

- **DOCUX-C1 / C2 – Rules mode and placement cap documentation:**
  - Expand `README.md` and/or `RULES_ENGINE_ARCHITECTURE.md` with a short “Rules Engine Modes” subsection that references `RINGRIFT_RULES_MODE` and clarifies shadow-mode parity behaviour.
  - Add a brief comment in `BOARD_CONFIGS` or the placement validator describing the stack-height approximation (CCE-002), with a pointer back to `RULES_CONSISTENCY_EDGE_CASES.md`.
- **CCE-001 / CCE-005 / CCE-006 / CCE-007 – Implementation compromises:**
  - Fold the remaining undocumented implementation compromises into targeted code comments and/or short subsections in the relevant rules/architecture docs, so future changes do not reintroduce the same edge cases.

These changes should be scheduled through the process in `UX_RULES_IMPROVEMENT_LOOP.md`, using telemetry from `ringrift_rules_ux_events_total` and curated teaching scenarios to measure impact where feasible.

## 4. Rules‑UX Concordance Table (W5)

This section provides a **single concordance view** for the highest‑risk rules concepts, mapping:

- Concept ids used in rules docs, telemetry, and teaching flows,
- Canonical rules references (RR‑CANON + public rulebook),
- Primary **in‑app copy** locations (HUD, VictoryModal, TeachingOverlay, sandbox, curated scenarios),
