# Archived Documentation

This directory contains historical snapshots, assessments, and plans that are no longer maintained.

Notes:

- These files are retained for historical context only.
- Some snapshots preserve raw merge history and may include unresolved conflict markers.
- For canonical docs, use `docs/` and `DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md`.
