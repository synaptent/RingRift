# CI job structure plan (rules vs parity vs integration vs Python)
#
# Current state:
# - lint-and-typecheck: ESLint + TS compilation for server/client.
# - test: npm run test:coverage (all Jest suites together).
# - build, security-scan, docker-build: packaging and security.
#
# Target state (to be implemented in a future workflow refactor):
# - ts-rules-engine:
#     - Run Jest on rules-level suites only (e.g. *.rules.test.ts,
#       RefactoredEngine*.test.ts, RulesMatrix.*.GameEngine/ClientSandboxEngine
#       when they are acting as pure rules scenarios).
#     - Treated as the canonical semantic signal; failures here should
#       fail CI early.
# - ts-parity:
#     - Run Jest on trace/parity suites (Backend_vs_Sandbox.*traceParity*.
#       test.ts, *Parity.RuleEngine_vs_Sandbox.test.ts,
#       Python_vs_TS.traceParity.test.ts, RNG parity, etc.).
#     - Used as smoke/regression coverage; failures are investigated with
#       the rules-over-traces policy (stale traces may be regenerated or
#       seeds retired in favour of focused rules tests).
# - ts-integration:
#     - Run Jest on integration-level suites (WebSocketServer.*.integration,
#       GameEngine.*WebSocketIntegration, FullGameFlow, route tests,
#       snapshot tests, etc.).
# - python-core:
#     - Run pytest for non-parity Python tests
#       (test_engine_correctness, test_env_interface, AI unit tests).
# - python-rules-parity:
#     - Run pytest on parity tests marked as rules-parity
#       (ai-service/tests/parity/* using TS-generated fixtures).
#     - Depends on TS fixture generation step that calls a small Node
#       script under tests/scripts/generate_rules_parity_fixtures.ts.
#
# When implementing this split, prefer:
# - rules-level jobs (ts-rules-engine, python-rules-parity) as the
#   highest-priority signals;
# - parity jobs as secondary, explicitly documenting when failures
#   indicate stale traces vs true rules regressions.
