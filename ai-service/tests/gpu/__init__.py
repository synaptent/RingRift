"""GPU parity tests for RingRift AI service.

This package contains tests that verify GPU-accelerated code produces
identical results to the canonical CPU implementation.

Test categories:
- Move generation parity (placement, movement, capture)
- Evaluation parity (heuristic scores)
- Full game parity (deterministic replay)
