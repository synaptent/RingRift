# Unified AI Self-Improvement Loop Configuration
# This file configures all aspects of the integrated improvement cycle.
#
# Tuned defaults based on observed cluster performance:
# - Shadow eval at 15min provides rapid feedback with minimal noise
# - Training threshold of 500 games balances quality vs freshness
# - Elo threshold of 25 reduces false positive promotions
# - Curriculum weights capped at 1.5x to avoid over-rotation
