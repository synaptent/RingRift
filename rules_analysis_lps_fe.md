# Rules Analysis: Last Player Standing & Forced Elimination

## Executive Summary

**Recommendation: Retain the Current Rule.**

The current definition of Last Player Standing (LPS)—which excludes Forced Elimination (FE) from "real actions"—better aligns with RingRift's design goals of strategic depth, decisiveness, and positional tension. Treating FE as a real action would degrade the LPS victory condition into a slower variant of Ring Elimination, removing a key strategic axis (immobilization/trapping) and prolonging games into "cleanup" phases.

## 1. The Strategic Distinction: Agency vs. Attrition

### Current Rule (FE is NOT a Real Action)
*   **Philosophy:** This rule distinguishes between **constructive agency** (placing, moving, capturing) and **destructive obligation** (being forced to consume one's own material to pass the turn).
*   **Effect:** It recognizes that a player who can *only* self-destruct has effectively lost control of the board. If this state persists for a full round (giving them a chance to break the lock via the FE itself), the game acknowledges their defeat.
*   **Chess Analogy:** This is similar to *Zugzwang*, where being forced to move is a disadvantage. The current rule treats a player in permanent Zugzwang as defeated, rather than forcing the opponent to capture every last piece.

### Proposed Rule (FE IS a Real Action)
*   **Philosophy:** As long as a player has material on the board, they are "alive" and participating.
*   **Effect:** A player completely trapped in a corner must be whittled down ring-by-ring until they have no stacks left.
*   **Consequence:** LPS becomes functionally identical to "Eliminate all opponent rings," just with a different trigger. It removes the unique "checkmate by immobilization" victory path.

## 2. Alignment with Design Goals

### Goal: "Exciting, tense, and strategically non-trivial games"
*   **Current Rule:** Creates high tension. A player trapped in a corner is on a "death clock". They must use their forced eliminations to break the trap *now*. If they fail to open a line of play within one round, they lose. This creates dramatic "breakout" moments.
*   **Proposed Rule:** Deflates tension. The trapped player can passively burn rings for many turns. The dominant player must tediously execute a containment squeeze to force the removal of every ring. This leads to "zombie" gameplay where a defeated player drags out the match.

### Goal: "High emergent complexity from simple rules"
*   **Current Rule:** Adds a layer of complexity: **Mobility is a resource.** You can win by material (Elimination), space (Territory), or *mobility* (LPS). This supports diverse strategies (e.g., a low-material "containment" strategy that wins by trapping a material-heavy opponent).
*   **Proposed Rule:** Collapses Mobility into Material. If FE counts as an action, then Mobility is just a function of having rings to burn. The strategy simplifies to "have more stuff," reducing the viability of clever containment plays.

### Goal: "Progress & Termination Guarantee"
*   **Current Rule:** Accelerates termination in "won" positions. Once a player is locked down, the game ends quickly (2 rounds).
*   **Proposed Rule:** Guarantees termination (eventually rings run out), but maximizes the length of the "cleanup" phase.

## 3. Scenario Analysis: The "Fortress"

Imagine Player A has trapped Player B's large stack in a corner. Player B cannot move.

*   **Under Current Rules:** Player B is "temporarily inactive". They must FE. If that FE doesn't unblock them (e.g., by reducing stack height to allow a shorter move), and they remain blocked for a full round, Player A wins. **Result:** Strategic victory for A's positioning.
*   **Under Proposed Rules:** Player B is "active". They FE. Next turn, they FE again. And again. Player A must wait (or try to attack a fortified position) until B burns through their entire stack. **Result:** Tedious attrition.

## 4. Conclusion

The proposed change would weaken the identity of RingRift as a game of *maneuver*. By equating "destroying one's own position" with "making a move," it devalues the strategic achievement of immobilizing an opponent. The current rule correctly identifies that a player who can only self-destruct is no longer playing the same game as the one who is moving and capturing; the LPS condition provides a merciful and decisive end to such states.
